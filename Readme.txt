Hello!
You are looking at the results of my work learning Javascript and this project took me a month and a half to complete. 
You'll notice 

Here are some things I've noticed about this program that I will try to implement in the future:

- My grid resizing does not work as I had planned. I built the BorderChecker and WholeShipBuilder functions with the idea of taking in the first randomly generated coordinate and extrapolating from there. Specifically, the fact that the number value of the random coordinate (generated from CoordSplitter) was how I determined the limit. By specifing if the last digit was less than 10, or if it was 0 then I knew it *had* to be 10. I know there's likely a way to rewrite them to accept a different number (hence the lenandwid variable), but I was just thrilled I got the full version working and I'm hesitant to fiddle with such a base component... yet. 

- Another issue with those two functions are that they do not fit well into the DRY or SRP methodologies of programming, and this was one of those things I sat down and tried to look at restructuring a few times, but I came up short. I hope to try again in a few months when I've gotten even better at JS and can apply new tricks that I'm not as comfortable with yet. 

- The three biggest hurdles for this project were 
    1. The coordinates builders.
    2. The duplicate checker.
    and 3. The clarifying victory settings. 

I will plan on returning to do parts 3 and 4 someday, but I'm excited to move on and hopefully someday I can feel like I can actually handle the actual challenges of a developer. 

Thank you.
